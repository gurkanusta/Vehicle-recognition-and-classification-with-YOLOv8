Vehicle Recognition and Classification with YOLOv8

This project implements a real-time vehicle recognition and classification
system using the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm. The system is designed
to detect and classify vehicles from images and video streams with high
accuracy and low latency.

The project focuses on applying modern computer vision and deep learning
techniques to a real-world problem and optimizing both detection performance
and inference speed.

Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:
- Apply deep learning techniques to object detection problems
- Gain hands-on experience with the YOLOv8 architecture
- Perform vehicle detection and classification in real time
- Understand the full pipeline of training, testing, and inference

---

Model and Approach

The system is based on the **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)** algorithm, which
performs object detection and classification in a single forward pass.
This enables high-speed inference suitable for real-time applications.

The model was trained and evaluated on vehicle-focused datasets, and
performance was analyzed in terms of detection accuracy and real-time
processing capability.
